# `.github` Directory

The `.github` directory in this repository contains configuration files and workflows for automating various tasks with GitHub Actions. This directory is a standard location in GitHub repositories where files related to GitHub-specific configurations are stored, such as workflows, issue templates, and pull request templates.

## Purpose

The `.github` directory is essential for setting up Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) workflows, as well as standardizing issue and pull request templates across the repository. GitHub Actions workflows, defined within this directory, automate repetitive tasks like running tests, checking code quality, building, and deploying code. This helps ensure that the codebase remains reliable and meets quality standards with each update.

## Key Files and Directories

- **`workflows/`**: This folder contains YAML files that define GitHub Actions workflows. Each workflow automates specific tasks, such as testing and linting code, upon code pushes or pull requests.
- **Workflow Files (`*.yml`)**: Each YAML file in `workflows/` represents a separate GitHub Actions workflow. These files define:
  - **Triggers**: When the workflow should run, such as on `push`, `pull_request`, or `schedule`.
  - **Jobs**: The tasks to be executed, like installing dependencies, running tests, or linting code.
  - **Steps**: Specific commands or actions that are part of each job.

## Example Workflow: `test.yml`

The `test.yml` workflow file is an example of a CI workflow in this project. It automates two main tasks:

1. **Run ESLint**: Checks for any code quality issues based on the project's linting rules.
2. **Run Unit Tests**: Runs the unit tests for the project to ensure that code changes don't break existing functionality.

## Key Sections of `test.yml`

- **`on`**: Defines the events that trigger the workflow. For example, this workflow runs on every push or pull request to the `main` branch.
- **`jobs`**: A workflow can have multiple jobs. In `test.yml`, there is a `test` job that sets up a Node.js environment and runs two steps:
  - **ESLint Step**: Runs the `npm run lint` command to check code quality.
  - **Unit Test Step**: Runs `npm test` to execute unit tests and verify the integrity of the codebase.

## Benefits of Using GitHub Actions

By using GitHub Actions in the `.github` directory, we automate essential tasks and create a **Continuous Integration (CI)** pipeline. This CI pipeline provides the following benefits:

- **Automated Testing**: Ensures that new code changes are automatically tested, making it easier to catch issues early.
- **Code Quality Enforcement**: Helps maintain a consistent code style and quality by enforcing linting rules.
- **Seamless Collaboration**: Each team member can see the status of tests and linting for each pull request, helping maintain code quality across the project.

## Additional Configuration Options

Aside from workflows, the `.github` directory can also contain:

- **Issue Templates**: Standardizes the format of issues submitted to the project, making it easier to categorize and track them.
- **Pull Request Templates**: Creates a standard format for pull requests, helping reviewers understand the purpose and scope of changes.
